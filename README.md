High-performance parallel engine for discovering pseudocycle patterns in Collatz sequences using Tuple-based Transform methodology.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Tuple-Based Transform

The reversible algorithm which transforms Collatz sequence values using the tuple $[p, f(p), m, q]$. Companion computational tools and step-by-step visualizations available [here](https://github.com/hhvvjj/a-new-algebraic-framework-for-the-collatz-conjecture). The complete theoretical framework is detailed in this [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15546925)

### Pseudocycle Detection

As the Tuple-based Transform generates sequence values, repetition of the multiplicity parameter $m$ indicates the existence of pseudocycles. These repeated $m$ values, called $m_r$, characterize different pseudocycle patterns. 

This is a high-performance parallel search engine to find $m_r$ pairs. It efficiently detects pseudocycles by analyzing the $m$-value repetition and generates detailed JSON output of all discovered $m_r$ pairs in the range of $1$ to $2^{exp} - 1$. 

### Research Findings

Comprehensive analysis of the complete range $1$ to $2^{40} - 1$ (1.099.511.627.775 numbers) reveals remarkable patterns in pseudocycle behavior:

**Unique $m_r$ Values Found (42 total):**
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 19, 25, 45, 53, 60, 79, 91, 121, 125, 141, 166, 188, 205, 243, 250, 324, 333, 432, 444, 487, 576, 592, 649, 667, 683, 865, 889, 1153, 1214, 1821, 2428, 3643
```

**Key Observations:**

- **Sparsity**: Only 42 distinct $m_r$ values across 1.1 trillion sequences, demonstrating extreme rarity of unique pseudocycle patterns
- **Structural Invariance**: Sequences of types B and C maintain constant counts (1.155 + 72 = 1.227 sequences) across all exponents, $exp \leq 40$, indicating fundamental structural properties independent of search range size

The observed structural invariance suggests deep underlying patterns in Collatz dynamics that merit further investigation at larger scales.
